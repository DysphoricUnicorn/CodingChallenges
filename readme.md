# My solutions to coding challenges

This repo is a place where I want to store my solutions to various coding challenges that I do when I have idle time.

It doesn't really serve a purpose but to show visitors to my GitHub profile what my code style is and how I approach 
different obstacles. Also.. you know.. coding challenges are a fun way to learn so I do them and I don't necessarily 
want them to just sit on my hard drive once they are done. \<sarcasm>Microsoft should also have them sitting on their hard drives.
\</sarcasm>

If I spoiled a solution that I shouldn't have feel free to contact me at codechallenges(at)dysphoric.dev and I'll remove it asap.
